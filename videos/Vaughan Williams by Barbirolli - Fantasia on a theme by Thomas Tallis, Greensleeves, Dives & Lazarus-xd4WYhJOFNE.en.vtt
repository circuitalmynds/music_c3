Vaughan Williams's Fantasia on a theme by Thomas Tallis (1910) is similar in layout to Elgar's Introduction and Allegro, for double string orchestra and string quartet, and is equally masterly in its exploitation and exploration of sonorities.

00:00:16.981 --> 00:00:29.958
Tallis's theme was contributed to a psalter in 1567 and used by Vaughan Williams when he edited The English Hymnal in 1906 for Addison's hymn 'When rising from the bed of death'.

00:00:29.958 --> 00:00:45.904
Although it rises at one point to a climax marked appassionato, the fantasia is solemn and ecclesiastical in mood and belongs to the acoustics of a cathedral such as Gloucester, where it was first performed. Barbirolli's 1962 recording (his second; the first was in 1946) was made in the Temple Church, part of the reason for its success.

00:00:45.904 --> 00:00:56.879
This venue was suggested by the American composer and conductor Bernard Herrmann, a friend and admirer of Barbirolli since Sir John's years in New York.

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:14.860
'There we went for a recording session that started at midnight to avoid any traffic noises,' Ursula Vaughan Williams wrote later. 'Coats and Thermos flasks were piled round the effigies of Crusader knights. Bernard was there, listening to the balance and to the music, and the resulting record is by far the best ever made of the work.'

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:28.838
All the works on this selection, including the evergreen Fantasia on 'Greensleeves' (another piece Barbirolli recorded several times), benefit from Sir John's special insight into string instruments resulting from his own experiences as a cellist.

00:01:28.838 --> 00:01:43.816
Vaughan Williams himself delighted in the emotional commitment Barbirolli brought to his music, the colours he found in it, and the care with which he tended scores sometimes dismissed by those out of sympathy with them as clumsily orchestrated.

00:01:43.816 --> 00:01:58.795
One has only to listen to the entwining of violin and viola solos in the Tallis Fantasia to know that a master orchestrator is at work â€” and, in this recording, a master conductor.  END
