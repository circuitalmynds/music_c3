00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:23.200
Once in a year I'm looking back

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.920
counting the hurts

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:32.100
Time after time it's been so hard

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.600
holding my ground

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.560
And I miss you

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:38.540
(For seven years)

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:39.420
An' need you

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:40.720
(For seven years)

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.660
Oh this lotto game

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.460
I don't wanna play...

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:50.820
(On the tray)

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.440

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.160
Has the same old fears in my heart

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.080
You can understand my blues

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:02.420
As I'm trying not to lose

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:04.140

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.820

And if time reveals you're the one

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.380
I hear everything you say

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.540
It's much easier to play

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.800
(On the tray)

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.640
Years passed me by and still I'm here

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.340
swallow the dreams

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:42.320
Posing in silk, we spoke to smile

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.240
trying to be strong

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.160
And I miss you

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.900
