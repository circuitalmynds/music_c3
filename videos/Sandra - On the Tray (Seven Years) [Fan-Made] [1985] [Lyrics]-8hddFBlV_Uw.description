Sandra On the Tray (Seven Years) 1985 Not official video clip! Lyrics in subs.
Another one of my favourite songs by the greatest singer Sandra Ann Lauer. 
Since, there's no footage of Sandra actually singing this song anywhere, I decided to make my own variant of it, like if she would have sang it. I would really want to find any footage of her singing this song.
This video I used in this clip is from "Heaven Can Wait, Goldene Europa 1988", btw.
