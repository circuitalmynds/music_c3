Here is a great classic of the repertoire taken from the superb 109-disc box set dedicated to Sir John Barbirolli (https://amzn.to/3mRQZIL). About the recording session, Ursula Vaughan Williams wrote: 'There we went for a recording session that started at midnight to avoid any traffic noises. Coats and Thermos flasks were piled round the effigies of Crusader knights. Bernard was there, listening to the balance and to the music, and the resulting record is by far the best ever made of the work.'
